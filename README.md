# Defining-and-Solving-Reinforcement-Learning-Task


The primary objective of this repository is to gain hands-on experience in formulating and addressing reinforcement learning (RL) challenges by adhering to the standards set by the Gym library. The project encompasses three distinct components. 

Initially, we concentrate on designing an environment that conforms to the principles of a Markov decision process (MDP).

Subsequently, in the second phase, we employ the SARSA algorithm, a tabular RL method, to tackle a pre-defined environment. 

Lastly, we employ the Q-learning technique to resolve a grid-world environment. Through these progressive steps, we aim to enhance our understanding and proficiency in RL problem-solving.
